This could give an indication about the type of articles they or their voters like to consume. For this we first need to label the articles headers as clikbait or non clickbait using Logistic regression which we train on a dataset with article headers where we aleady know if they are clickbiat or not. Then we can compare the clikcbait artice use between democrats and republicans taking into account their total amount of tweets and look at potential factors why one party uses more clickbait articles than the other.\n",

        "\n",
        "We have seen that using a logistic regression as classifier that Democrats refer to Clickbait inn 18 % percent of all their tweets whereas Republicans do so only for 14%. \n",
        "Moreover, the difference Is significant. \n",
        "In total numbers Democrats have 1722 more clickbait title. Intuitively, one might that think that republicans refer more to clickbait articles. \n",
        "\n",
        "Whymore intuitive? Because the stemvoters of the republicanparty are majorly working class and thus often less educated. Classic clickbait titles such as: “Find out how you can make 4000 Dollars from home” might be more attractive to less educated people.\n",
        "\n",
        "A look at the first 60 rows and titles of our newly labelled data frames gives us a hint why democrats could proprtionally more cb articles. There are many clickbait articles by the democrats with the same title. “I just gave”. This refers to a donation campaign by the democrats after Justice Ruth Bader Ginsburg’s death was announced where they reached a record-number of donations, as seen here also with the help of twitter.\n",
        "\n",
        "https://www.nytimes.com/2020/09/18/us/elections/democrats-shatter-actblues-donation-records-after-ginsburgs-death.html\n",
        "\n",
        "In fact if we look at the amount of clickbait titles with this type among democrats, we can see that they constitute for 23 clickbait titles among democrats\n",
        "There is also a striking difference between Clickbait articles related to the Coronavirus between  Democrats and Republicans. This is line with reports suggesting that Democrats care more about the Coronavirus than Republicans\n",
        "Democats also gave much more Clickbait insructions on “how to vote”.\n",
        "\n",
        "Lastly,we saw that New York Times which is mainly cited by the Democrats accounts for 8% and the most of all clickbait articles (312 of a total of 3909 clickbait titles)which could be a main driver for significant difference of clickbait titles proportians between the two parties. A similar pattern can be obeserved for CNN. Politico.com a popular news source by the Republicans does not seem be very clickbaity.\n",
